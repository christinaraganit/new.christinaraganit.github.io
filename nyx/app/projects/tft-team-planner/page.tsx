        <p className="text-neutral-400 xl:mb-4 xl:text-lg">
          Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game where players compete
          online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last
          one standing. There's an in-game feature called Team Planner which has
          a lot of potential for improvement, but it might be a while before we
          get to see any changes.

          As an avid TFT player, I was excited to take on this passion project.
          After sifting through tons of player feedback, I designed what the
          future of the Team Planner might look like for desktop. I shared the
          prototypes I created in the Teamfight Tactics subreddit and received
